                    My name is Sunee Sangmit, my parents are both from China, they both fled the country on a boat at a very young age in the 
                    1930s. The country was facing a civil war and poverty. They both settled down in Bangkok Thailand, eventually moving to the 
                    countryside after different ventures of business and jobs, they ended up doing a rice business. My parents had 5 children 
                    including me, one older brother and sister, one younger brother and one sister. After getting my GED I went onto college with 
                    my older sister in health science. After graduating and getting my bachelor’s degree I moved to my America and met my husband 
                    over there. I continued on to get my master’s degree in Health science. After graduating from San Francisco State University I 
                    moved down to Los Angeles California with my husband. I eventually had two kids, Arisara and Steven Sangmit. After working in 
                    America for a short time I decided to ask my dad to help with running my own jewelry business, while my husband worked as an 
                    accountant for a short time. I have several hobbies I enjoy, I enjoy playing video games with my children as that is a way to 
                    bond with them, I also enjoy collecting coins with different landmarks, lastly I enjoy journaling. I journal the happy and sad 
                    days of my life, I keep the entries brief and I decorate it with images and other various stationery.
